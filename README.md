# Introduction
Only the advanced statistical regression technology is used, and the regression technology in the field of machine learning is not used for housing price prediction. Several regression methods are compared, such as ridge regression, multiple regression, linear regression, polynomial regression, elastic network regression, etc. After selecting the optimal model, a variety of optimization techniques are used to optimize the model results, such as Bayesian parameter search, model coupling, etc.
