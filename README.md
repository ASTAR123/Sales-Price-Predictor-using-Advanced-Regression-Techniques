# Sales-Price-Predictor-using-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

# Abstract
In the current era, buying a dream house has 
become a difficult task for most people as there are many 
possible issues such as hidden costs and lack of clear, reliable 
information. The objective of this project is to develop a 
predictive model, create robust and generalizable model and 
combine data science and domain knowledge of model. The 
techniques used in this project are linear regression, complex 
exponential regression, ridge regression and elastic net 
regression and lasso regression. Among all the models, various 
techniques, like Bayesian Optimizer, F1 Feature Selection and 
Early Stopping will be applied to obtain the best model. The best 
model obtained will be ridge quantic polynomial regression. 
With our best model perform stable, we wish to try out 
techniques, such as data augmentation in the future.

# Introduction
Only the advanced statistical regression technology is used, and the regression technology in the field of machine learning is not used for housing price prediction. Several regression methods are compared, such as ridge regression, multiple regression, linear regression, polynomial regression, elastic network regression, etc. After selecting the optimal model, a variety of optimization techniques are used to optimize the model results, such as Bayesian parameter search, model coupling, etc.

# Conclusion
Overall, our regression model is roughly able to 
accurately predict house prices, but there is an issue with the 
distribution of outliers in real house prices. If we directly 
handle these outliers, we might lose the ability to accurately 
predict specific house prices in the real world. However, if 
we don't address these outliers, our model will suffer from 
significant errors. This situation presents a dilemma for us.
In the current model, while most predicted values 
are close to the actual values, some data points show 
significant deviations. These deviations are primarily 
found in the extreme high and low house price ranges. To 
improve the accuracy of the model, we need to find a 
balance between handling outliers and maintaining the 
ability to predict real house prices accurately. T
